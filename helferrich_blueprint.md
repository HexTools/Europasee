Scope

Naval module for Europa(tm) ground games to replace what is currently in Second Front(tm).  For use in particular with games involving the Mediterranean (e.g. Balkan Front(tm), War in the Desert(tm), Italy's War Grand Europa scenario, etc.)

Constraints

No extra maps.  Minimum additions to existing maps (e.g. sea zone boundaries).
Use of existing Europa ship counters (e.g. Spanish CA and CL in For Whom the Bell Tolls(tm)), and limited number of new counters in same format.
Very limited length of rules, comparable to naval rules in Second Front.  Maximum use of existing rules.
