# Fred's Europa Maritime Blueprint

<b>SCOPE</b>

Naval module for Europa(tm) ground games to replace what is currently in Second Front(tm).  For use in particular with games involving the Mediterranean (e.g. Balkan Front(tm), War in the Desert(tm), Italy's War Grand Europa scenario, etc.)

<b>CONSTRAINTS</b>

No extra maps.  Minimum additions to existing maps (e.g. sea zone boundaries).
Use of existing Europa ship counters (e.g. Spanish CA and CL in For Whom the Bell Tolls(tm)), and limited number of new counters in same format.
Very limited length of rules, comparable to naval rules in Second Front.  Maximum use of existing rules.

<b>GENERAL</b>

Major sea zones:  2 for Mediterranean Sea (east and west, boundary to be determined with testing), 4 for Atlantic Ocean (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest), 1 for Norwegian Sea, 1 for Baltic Sea, 1 for Indian Ocean and Red Sea.
